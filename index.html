            <h3>Paragraph 1 — Classical Guitar</h3>
            <img id="pic1" src="images/hhhh.png" alt="Classical guitar performance" />
            <p class="para p1">
              I have been a classical guitarist for a decade and have earned five First Class Honors and two First Class Honors with Distinction awards for my practical exams, and two First Class Honors and two First Class Honors with Distinction awards for my theory exams. Therefore, I have won three regional gold medals from the Royal Conservatory of Music, have performed at University of Southern California's Newman Hall for the two regional golds I won in one academic school year, and will perform at the Colburn School in Los Angeles in March of 2026 due to only placing second in my level in the United States.
              <span class="highlight">Additionally, I have performed in multiple other venues, including All Souls' Episcopal Church, California Center for the Arts, and the Jacobs Music Center.</span>
              In February of 2025, I was selected out of several hundreds of students as the Villa Musica Student of the Month and have served as an inspirational figure for several musicians. I currently play <a href="https://www.guitarsalon.com/product/vicente-carrillo-india-estudio-cd-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vicente Carillo's 2024 India Estudio CD/IN</a> using high tension Augustine Regal Crystal Nylon Classical Guitar Strings, as I find the higher tension and durability is able to withstand the power I exert while maintaining a rich sound quality and projecting the sound properly.

            <p class="para p2">
              In my free time, I code and help my sister with projects using a variety of languages, mainly Python. I also enjoy immersing myself in classic literature—some of my favorite works include <em>War and Peace</em>, <em>The Hobbit</em>, and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy—and I’m currently reading <em>Crime and Punishment</em>. Last winter break, I was admitted into the
              <a href="https://www.rosettainstitute.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rosetta Institute of Biomedical Research</a>'s winter program, which sparked my interest in biotech. In the future, I aspire to enter the biotech industry and contribute to innovations that blend technology and life sciences. Alongside these interests, I also participate in math competitions such as the AMC and Integirls, and was recently admitted to AwesomeMath's summer program and am currently enrolled at its online academy.

            <h3>Paragraph 3 — About Me</h3>
            <img id="pic3" src="images/aaaaaa.jpeg" alt="Canyon Crest Academy student life" />
            <p class="para p3">
              I am currently a sophomore at
              <a href="https://cc.sduhsd.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canyon Crest Academy</a>.
             I am taking Chemistry Honors, AP Computer Science Principles, Digital Art and Design, and AP World History. In the coming semester, I will take English 10 Honors, Physical Education Year 2, AP Chemistry, and AP Calculus BC. In my freshman year at CCA, I took Biology, Spanish 3, Integrated Math 3 Honors, and Introduction to Engineering techniques in the fall semester, and English 9 Honors, Computer Science Foundations, AP Calculus AB, and Physical Education Year 1. I have taught several group classes and tutored several individuals over my lifetime, starting in 4th grade–and have therefore amassed six years of tutoring experience. I look forward to taking more classes.
