          <p class="para p1">
            I have been a classical guitarist for a decade and have earned five First Class Honors and two First Class Honors with Distinction awards for my practical exams, and two First Class Honors and two First Class Honors with Distinction awards for my theory exams. Therefore, I have won three regional gold medals from the Royal Conservatory of Music, have performed at University of Southern California's Newman Hall for the two regional golds I won in one academic school year, and will perform at the Colburn School in Los Angeles in March of 2026 due to only placing second in my level in the United States.
            <span class="highlight">Additionally, I have performed in multiple other venues, including All Souls' Episcopal Church, California Center for the Arts, and the Jacobs Music Center.</span>
            In February of 2025, I was selected out of several hundreds of students as the Villa Musica Student of the Month and have served as an inspirational figure for several musicians. I currently play

          <p class="para p2">
            In my free time, I code and help my sister with projects using a variety of languages, mainly Python. I also enjoy immersing myself in classic literature—some of my favorite works include <em>War and Peace</em>, <em>The Hobbit</em>, and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy—and I’m currently reading <em>Crime and Punishment</em>. Last winter break, I was admitted into the

            workshop, where I studied biology and analyzed unknown genome sequences, sparking my interest in biotech. Alongside these interests, I also participate in math competitions such as the AMC and Integirls, and I’m currently enrolled in AwesomeMath’s online academy.

            taking Chemistry Honors, AP Computer Science Principles, Digital Art and Design, and AP World History.

In my freshman year at CCA, I took Biology, Spanish 3, Integrated Math 3 Honors, and Introduction to Engineering Techniques in the fall, and English 9 Honors, Computer Science Foundations, AP Calculus AB, and PE Year 1 in the spring. I’ve taught several group classes and tutored individuals since 4th grade, building six years of tutoring experience—and I’m excited to keep learning.
